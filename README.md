# Flight Price Prediction: Deploying Machine Learning with Django

Experience seamless flight price prediction locally with a deployed machine learning model using the Django framework. Input your parameters to receive instant predictions for your flights.

## About The Project

The deployment phase, the culminating stage of the Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining [(CRISP-DM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-industry_standard_process_for_data_mining), is pivotal in transforming analytical insights into actionable solutions. While [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/) and [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) are prominent choices, this tutorial diverges, spotlighting Django's robust capabilities. With a singular objective in mind – facilitating the deployment of machine learning models – this tutorial serves as a comprehensive guide for predicting flight prices, exemplifying Django's prowess in facilitating sophisticated model deployment.
