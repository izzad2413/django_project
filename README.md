## About The Project

The deployment phase, the culminating stage of the Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining [(CRISP-DM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-industry_standard_process_for_data_mining), is pivotal in transforming analytical insights into actionable solutions. While [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/) and [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) are prominent choices, this tutorial diverges, spotlighting Django's robust capabilities. With a singular objective in mind – facilitating the deployment of machine learning models – this tutorial serves as a comprehensive guide for predicting flight prices, exemplifying Django's prowess in facilitating sophisticated model deployment.

## Dataset

The flight booking dataset, sourced from Kaggle, offers comprehensive insights into flight booking options available on the Easemytrip website for travel between India's top 6 metro cities. With a total of 300261 distinct flight bookings and 11 informative features, this dataset provides a rich resource for analyzing and understanding booking patterns and preferences within the Indian aviation market.
