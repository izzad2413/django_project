## Methodology

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Conducted thorough exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset's structure, identify patterns, and uncover any anomalies.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Preprocessed the dataset, including converting categorical data into appropriate formats suitable for modeling.
- **Modeling:** Employed logistic regression and deep learning techniques to predict flight prices.
- **Model Selection and Deployment:** Selected the best-performing model for deployment using the Django framework.
